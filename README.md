# portfolio
This is my first portfolio build, I will be making additional changes
Updated index.html - removed inline js, replaceed with a source link and js file, repositioned banner text and nav links
Updated CSS - added transitions to slider bars, skill images, and dialogue box. 
Changed color of the night time background to a lighter black
Replaced social media images and email in footer and changed the colors to fit the theme
Repoisitioned the github and linkedin images - were too close together
